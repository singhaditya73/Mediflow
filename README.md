# Mediflow 🏥
⸻
### Mediflow transforms healthcare data management by giving patients full ownership of their medical records through a secure, decentralized platform.We standardize scattered, bulky physical records into the FHIR format, store them safely using IPFS and Blockchain, and enable easy identity linking with Aadhaar for verified health profiles.
⸻

## Key Features
	•	🩺 FHIR Integration: Converts unstructured medical prescriptions and documents into standardized FHIR resources.
	•	🔗 Web3 & Blockchain: Ensures secure, tamper-proof access and an immutable audit trail for all medical data.
	•	📂 Decentralized Storage (IPFS): Guarantees high availability, resilience, and privacy for patient data.
	•	🛡️ Smart Contracts: Automates and secures access permissions — patients can easily grant or revoke access.
	•	🧠 Machine Learning + NLP: Extracts structured information from scanned prescriptions and documents.
	•	🆔 Aadhaar Linking: Creates a unique, verifiable health identity for each patient.
	•	🔒 Advanced Encryption: End-to-end encryption of all medical data, compliant with HIPAA and global privacy laws.

## How it Works
	1.	Upload Medical Records
	•	Patients upload prescriptions or lab reports via the platform.
	2.	AI-Based Processing
	•	Machine Learning + NLP models extract and organize text into FHIR-compliant structures.
	3.	FHIR Resource Creation
	•	The extracted data is converted into standardized FHIR DiagnosticReport or Patient resources.
	4.	Decentralized Storage
	•	FHIR resources are stored securely on IPFS, ensuring distributed, tamper-proof storage.
	5.	Blockchain Access Control
	•	Access rights are managed through blockchain smart contracts, with full control given to the patient.
	6.	Identity Linking
	•	Patients can link their FHIR identity to their Aadhaar number for seamless verification.
